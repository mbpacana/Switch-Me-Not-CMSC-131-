# Switch Me Not 
SWITCH ME NOT is an assembly game based on basic platformer games. The goal of this game is to guide the ‘jumpers’ through obstacles and avoid getting hit. The player must jump over obstacles to traverse the environment. The twist within the game is that the player will have to control two (2) ‘jumpers’ simultaneously. The controls of respective jumpers will randomly switch as the player’s score increases.
